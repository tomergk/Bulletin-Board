# Bulletin Board

Welcome to my Bulletin Board project! This repository hosts a simple and interactive bulletin board application where users can create posts with titles, content, and author information. These posts are then displayed alongside other contributions, allowing users to share their thoughts, ideas, and messages with the world.

## Features

- Create posts with a title, content, and author.
- View and browse all posts submitted by various users.
- Search for posts by their title.
- Check the time signature to know when each post was written.

3. Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure your MongoDB connection URI. For example:
